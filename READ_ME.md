My final project is an implementation of the Space Invaders game for android. 
Although this differs a good deal from my original proposition of creating Tetris for android, 
the core points are still the same. The game features more than 3 activities (5), RecyclerView with custom adapter, 
Menu item,Use of SharedPreferences, Animation, Use of hardware (orientation)
The game is played pivoting the phone to move and tapping on the screen to shoot. 
Each time you play a new game, you will be asked to record your name to be placed onto the leaderboards once you 
complete your game.
